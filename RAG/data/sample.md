# LangChain Main Applications

- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Answer questions over your docs, wikis, tickets, and codebases using chunking, embeddings, retrievers, re-ranking, and citations.
- Multi-step Workflows: Summarize, extract, translate, and classify at scale using deterministic chains and map-reduce patterns.
- Tool-Using Agents: Safely call APIs, databases, search, and internal tools with plan→act loops (often built with LangGraph for reliability).
- Structured Extraction: Produce typed JSON or fill schemas from semi-structured text via output parsers and validation.
- Conversational AI with Memory: Build chat experiences that remember context and can take actions through function/tool calling.
- Code & Data Assistants: Repo Q&A, refactoring helpers, SQL generation over warehouses/lakes, and “chat with your data.”
