Agents vs. Workflows

Workflows (Chains)
- Deterministic, linear or branching steps.
- Great for summarization, extraction, translations, and batch jobs.
- Easier to test and reason about.

Agents
- Decide which tool to use next based on intermediate results.
- Useful when querying APIs/DBs, browsing, or orchestrating multiple tools.
- Prefer structured state machines (e.g., LangGraph) for reliability.

Rule of Thumb
- Start with a workflow; add agentic steps only when necessary.
