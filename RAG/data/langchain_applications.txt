LangChain Main Applications

1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Answer questions over private docs, wikis, tickets, and codebases.
- Uses chunking, embeddings, vector search, optional re-ranking, and citations.

2) Multi-step Workflows
- Summarization, extraction, translation, and classification at scale.
- Deterministic chains and map-reduce patterns for reliability.

3) Tool-Using Agents
- Safely call APIs, databases, search, and internal tools.
- Use explicit planners/routers; prefer LangGraph for robust state.

4) Structured Extraction
- Generate typed JSON or fill schemas from semi-structured text.
- Use output parsers and validation/repair loops.

5) Conversational AI with Memory
- Persistent session memory or vector-backed recall for long-running chats.
- Function/tool calling to take actions.

6) Code & Data Assistants
- Repo Q&A, PR summaries, refactor suggestions, SQL generation and analysis.
