RAG Tips and Best Practices

- Chunking: Tune chunk_size and chunk_overlap; start with ~800/120.
- Metadata: Store filename, section, page numbers for better citations.
- Hybrid Search: Mix dense (embeddings) with keyword/BM25 when possible.
- Re-ranking: Use a cross-encoder or LLM for top-k re-ranking to improve precision.
- Prompting: Keep a concise instruction and inject context clearly.
- Answer Style: Ask for sources and encourage “I don’t know” when unsure.
- Evaluation: Measure retrieval recall and groundedness, not just fluency.
- Guardrails: Timeouts, max tokens, and tool-call limits to control cost/latency.
